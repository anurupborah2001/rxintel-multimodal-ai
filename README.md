# RxIntel Multimodal AI - AI-Powered Prescription & Side-Effect Analysis using Large Language Models

End-to-end multimodal AI for prescription understanding and medication side-effect analysis using Vision, OCR, and Biomedical LLMs.

RxIntel Multimodal AI is an end-to-end healthcare-focused intelligent system for prescription understanding and medication insight extraction, combining computer vision, OCR, and large language models (LLMs). The project detects and parses prescription labels, extracts structured medication information, and leverages biomedical LLMs to generate clinically relevant insights such as drug usage, side effects, and safety considerations.

The system is designed to handle noisy real-world prescription data and demonstrates a multimodal pipeline that bridges image-based medical documents with natural language reasoning, making it suitable for healthcare analytics, clinical decision support, and medical AI research.
